Steps up to this point (Point A, 10:31 am):
- Created some files
- Created a directory
- Added some files to the directory
- Initialized the repository as a git repository
using 'git init' 
- We used 'git status' to see the state of the git repot at several points, including after. 'init', 'add', and 'commit'.
- We added all the files that we wanted to version to the staging area(readme, 2 nbs) using ' git add'
- We committed the changes in the staging area.
- After running git status, we saw that the 3 files were created

Steps up to this point (Point B, 11:03 am):
- Git diff : Through git diff, we checked the updated txt inside README.txt
(show changes to the specific file since its last change)
- Git log : checked our logging (Show the commit history (meassages and hashes) and dates/author with messages indicating the changes) 
- .gitignore : wrote down the files to be ignored (git add . is for all of the files) Sometimes it is really nice to be able to 'git add /'. this means that files in the gitignore are ignored.
